                        storage?</h2>
                    <p class="blog-post">
                        The Browser Storage or the Client-side Storage works on similar principles to the server-side
                        storage but has different
                        use cases. It consists of JavaScript APIs that allow us to store data on the client (i.e., on
                        the user's machine), and
                        then it could be retrieved when needed. Some of the differences between session storage and
                        local
                        storage are given below:


                        <li class="mark-point">localStorage is similar to sessionStorage, except that while data stored
                            in localStorage has
                            no expiration time, data
                            stored in sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is
                            closed.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            data stored in either localStorage or sessionStorage is specific to the origin of the page,
                            which is a combination of
                            the protocol, host and the port.
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            Session storage stores data for a specific period of time. This means that SessionStorage
                            data life is for a limited
                            time. As long as the user closes the tab, session storage data also remove from the session
                            storage. On the other hand,
                            when we store data in local storage it stores that data permanently in the browser. Whenever
                            the user returns to that
                            tab he gets back all the data that he stores in localStorage.
                        </li>

                        scope?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post">
                        <p>
                            "Scope" means which variable is accessible and up to which point it is accessible. In
                            javascript, the whole document is
                            the global scope and all the other functions and variables are contained in this global
                            scope.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another is the Local Scope when we declared variables inside the functions are considered to
                            be of the local scope and
                            it is further divided into function scoped and block scope. A variable when declared inside
                            the if or switch conditions
                            or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To be consistent the variables declared inside the curly braces are called within block
                            scope. var is called a function
                            scope that is if a variable is declared using the var keyword it will be accessible
                            throughout the function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            let & const are also called block scope that is they are accessible within that particular
                            block. Here let is used for
                            variables that can be changed as we proceed through the program whereas const is used for a
                            variable that doesn't change
                            till the program ends, that is it remains constant throughout the program.

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Question 03: Discuss how Js Event Loop work?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post">
                        <p>
                            The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                            operations on a single
                            thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into
                            the browser. Based on the
                            command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack
                            and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will
                            take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
                            Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is
                            called a tick in the Event Loop. Each event is just a function
                            callback.
                        </p>

                    <h2 class="blog-title">Question 04: Discuss how many ways we get undefined value?</h2>
                    <div class="blog-post">
                        <p>
                            Undefined is a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined
                            value when no value is
                            assigned before using it. So we can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown
                            value. Let's see when and how we get an undefined value:-
                        </p>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            declare var but value not initialized. When we declare a variable but we didn't set any
                            value then it will show an undefined result. Example: <br>
                            <code>
                                let first;//undefined
                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            function with no return will also show an undefined result. Example: <br>
                            <code>
                                function second(a, b) { <br>
                                const total = a + b;<br>
                                }<br>
                                const result = second();//undefined
                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            If we declare parameters but will not passed will also output and undefined
                            value. Example:<br>
                            <code>
                                function third(a, b, c, d) { <br>
                                const total = a + b + c + d; <br>
                                console.log(a, b, c, d);
                                }<br>
                                third(2, 3);// 2 3 undefined undefined
                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            if return has nothing on the right side will also return undefined. Ex: <br>
                            <code>
                                function noNegative(a, b) { <br>
                                if (a < 0 || b < 0) {<br>
                                    return;<br>
                                }<br>
                                return a + b;<br>
                            }<br>
                                const total=noNegative(2, -5);//undefined
                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            Property that doesn't exist on an object will give an undefined value. Ex: <br>
                            <code>
                                const obj = { name: "ismail", age: 23 }; <br>
                                console.log(obj.profession); <br>
                                //undefined
                            </code>

                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            accessing array element outside of the index range will give undefined. Ex: <br>
                            <code>
                                const arr = [12, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                                console.log(arr[5]);//undefined

                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            if we delete and array element then want to get it. <br>
                            <code>
                                const arr = [12, 3, 4, 5] <br>
                                delete arr[1];<br>
                                console.log(arr);//[ 12, <1 empty item>, 4, 5 ]
                            </code>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mark-point">
                            set a value directly to undefined. If we set a variable value to undefined then it will also
                            return an undefined result. Ex: <br>
                            <code>
                            const age = undefined; <br>
                            console.log(age);//undefined
                           </code>

                        </li>
                        Finally Above way we get and undefined value. if a value doesn't exist and we explicitly want to
                        set that value we can use null.
